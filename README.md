# La Sape

La Sape is Crisis Text Line's live pattern library/style guide. It is built on top of a [SASS port](https://github.com/doabit/semantic-ui-sass) of [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/elements/button.html). The static files for displaying the pattern library are generated by [Fabricator](https://github.com/fbrctr/fabricator). They are hosted as a GitHub page here: [http://crisistextline.github.io/La-Sape](http://crisistextline.github.io/La-Sape).

## Getting Started

Fabricator requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org), so make sure you have `v0.10` or higher installed before proceeding.

**Initializing the Submodule:**

Since we are bringing in the SASS port of Semantic UI as a submodule, you will have to do the following in the repo directory:

```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

After the initial initialization, you'll just need to run the update to keep the submodule up-to-date with the main repo.

**Start the local development environment:**

```
$ npm start
```
## Checkout the main branch

1. The main branch for this repo is 'gh-pages'
```
$ git checkout gh-pages
```


## Compiling to static HTML

2. When you are done making your changes, make sure to run the following, to compile the production version of the static HTML and asset files:

```
$ npm run build
```

3. Once the build script has finished, commit to a new branch and submit a PR.

Fabricator builds both a static documentation site and optimized CSS and JS toolkit files. Static files are compiled in the `dist` directory. You can view the files here: [http://crisistextline.github.io/La-Sape](http://crisistextline.github.io/La-Sape)
